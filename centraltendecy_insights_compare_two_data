Descriptive statistics, such as the mean, can provide you with some initial insights into whether two data sets are different, but they do not provide a definitive test of statistical significance. Descriptive statistics give you a summary of the data, such as the central tendency (mean), dispersion (standard deviation), and other characteristics.

Here's what you can infer from the mean and descriptive statistics alone:

1. **Difference in Central Tendency:** If the means of the two data sets are noticeably different, it suggests that there might be a difference between the groups. However, this observation alone does not confirm statistical significance.

2. **Magnitude of Difference:** You can also assess the magnitude of the difference between the means. A larger difference is more likely to be statistically significant than a smaller one. However, the significance of the difference depends on the variability within the data.

3. **Variability:** Consider the variability within each group. If one group has a larger standard deviation (greater variability) than the other, it can affect the interpretation of the difference in means. In such cases, a statistical test is important to account for this variability.

4. **Sample Size:** Sample size matters. A small difference in means may be statistically significant if you have a very large sample size, whereas a large difference may not be significant with a small sample.

5. **Confidence Interval:** It's often helpful to calculate confidence intervals around the means to get a sense of the precision of the estimates. A wide confidence interval indicates more uncertainty.

To draw a more definitive conclusion about whether the observed difference in means is statistically significant, you should conduct a hypothesis test like the t-test or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) if you have more than two groups. These tests take into account the sample size, variability, and the chosen significance level (alpha) to provide a statistical determination of whether the observed difference is likely to be real or due to random chance.

In summary, while descriptive statistics like the mean can provide initial insights, they are not a substitute for hypothesis testing when you want to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant. Hypothesis tests provide a more rigorous and objective assessment of significance.
